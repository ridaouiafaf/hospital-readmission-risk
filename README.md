# Predicting Hospital Readmissions

This repository will contain an end-to-end machine learning project focused on predicting 30-day hospital readmission risk using clinical and administrative patient data.

## Project Overview

The goal is to build a pipeline that:

- Cleans and preprocesses a large, messy healthcare dataset
- Handles categorical features, missing values, and class imbalance
- Trains and compares several ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Evaluates performance using ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, calibration curves, and threshold-based metrics
- Explains predictions with SHAP values for interpretability in a healthcare context


## Why This Project

- Hospital readmissions are a key quality metric in healthcare. Early prediction can help allocate resources, improve patient follow-up, and reduce costs.
- This project is also a step-up from my previous work on the Heart Disease dataset:
 - More complex dataset (higher dimensionality, multiple categorical features)

 - Stronger focus on class imbalance and data leakage prevention

 - Emphasis on model explainability and fairness


## Status

ðŸš§ Work in progress â€” notebook and code will be uploaded soon.
